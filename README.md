# deltaonboarding

This repository was originally intended to be in fulfillment of the practical assignment that was given to me during the interview process at The Delta.
The intention behind it is that it would demonstrate some basic skills that one would have acquired for production use.

At the moment the project is still a work in progress - a full version of these views and comments will be fleshed out in the coming days.
